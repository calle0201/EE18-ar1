        <h1>Halloween in Sweden</h1>
        <p>
            Halloween has only been celebrated in Sweden since the 1990s, and has rapidly become established here − not least as a result of smart commercial marketing. By the beginning of November, Sweden is enveloped in darkness and the long working weeks stretch away endlessly.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are no public holidays or extended weekends in the calendar between the summer holiday and All Saints’ Day. Halloween heralds the schools’ autumn break and represents a welcome diversion in the gathering dark.
